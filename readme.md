# Jabberwocky UI

This jquery project serves the [REST API contract](https://github.com/fusejw/server/blob/main/api/swagger.yaml) to allow management of `Connector`s, `Channel`s and `Event Source/Sink`s.

## How to run locally

Launch the API server following the [related instruction](https://github.com/fusejw/server/). Now you can browse via firefox (to allow consume the API from localhost) starting locally from `index.html`.

## How to install in a cluster

The above instruction is useful if you're intend to develop the application. If you want to just install and run on your cluster, please follow the [related instruction](https://github.com/fusejw/install/).

## Caveat

The project is still in prototype phase, structure and dependency management need to be reviewed.
