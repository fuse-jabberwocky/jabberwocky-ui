# Jabberwocky UI

This jquery project serves the [REST API contract](https://github.com/fuse-jabberwocky/jabberwocky-api/blob/main/openapi/openapi.yaml) to allow management of `Connector`s, `Channel`s and `Event Source/Sink`s.

## How to run

Launch the API server following the [related instruction](https://github.com/fuse-jabberwocky/jabberwocky-api). Now you can browse via firefox (to allow consume the API from localhost) starting locally from `index.html`.

## Caveat

The project is still in prototype phase, structure and dependency management need to be reviewed.
